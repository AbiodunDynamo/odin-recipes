            <li>4 thick slices French bread</li>
            <li>8 slices Gruyère cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Asiago cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>4 pinches paprika</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1</strong>
                <p>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat.
                    Stir in red onions, sweet onions, and salt. 
                    Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are 
                    caramelized and almost syrupy, about 35 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 2</strong>
                <p>Stir in chicken broth, beef broth, red wine, and Worcestershire sauce. 
                    Bundle parsley, thyme, and bay leaf with kitchen twine; add to the pot. 
                    Simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                    Remove and discard herb bundle. Reduce heat to low; stir in vinegar
                     and season with salt and pepper. 
                    Cover soup and keep warm over low heat while you prepare the toast.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 3</strong>
                <p>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
                     Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet and broil, turning once, 
                     until well toasted on both sides, about 3 minutes. 
                     Remove from heat; do not turn off the broiler.

                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 4</strong>
                <p>Arrange 4 large oven-safe bowls or crocks on a rimmed baking sheet. 
                    Fill each bowl 2/3 full with hot soup. Top each bowl with 1 slice of toasted bread,
                     2 slices Gruyère cheese, and 1/4 of the Asiago cheese.
                      Sprinkle a little bit of paprika over the top of each one.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 5</strong>
                <p>Cook under the hot broiler until bubbly and golden brown, about 5 minutes.
                     Cheese will cascade over the sides of the crock and
                      form a beautifully melted crusty seal as it melts.
